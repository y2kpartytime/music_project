-Edward Sanders, TU984

The project is a DnB/Jungle soundboard kit. It's a simple DAW-like project, designed for the user to get familiar with the common tools and sounds used in the creation of Jungle and DnB music. 

The main goal is to introduce people to older music and a fun program to mess around and create simple songs with, without a sequencer.
It has all the core features required to start thinking about or play around with creating music without the need to purchase or pirate a DAW.
